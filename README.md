# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to create several machine learning models to predict the credit risks for a company named Fast Lending. The idea of using machine learning models will lead to a more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates. 

For the challenge, a high quality analysis was done to code and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. Various techniques were implemented to carry on the analysis, such as re sampling and boosting to make most of the models. After the models are implemented, an evaluation was made to verify the efficacy of the algorithms. The results are shown below.
